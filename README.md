# USlicing
Plugin using procedural meshes to simulate cutting

#### UE Version: 4.22

### Project description

* This project tries to implement a way of enabling objects to realistically cut other objects. This is done by making specific objects be able to cut or be cuttable.
* It's possible to define an object that needs to be cut through the Unreal Editor by editing an already existing static mesh and defining specific areas needed for the cutting.
* Debug options allow the user to see different properties (e.g. cutting trajectory) while cutting another object in-game.
